ws-session
==========

Session management on a 'virtual desktop', 'workspace' or 'tag' basis.

You can configure what should be part of your sessions: browser history/tabs, bash history, terminals with cwd, editors and open files, open pdfs, ncurses applications and commands like mutt, htop, ssh (tmux attach) and everything else you can think of/write a wrapper.

Configuration
-------------
Get the code, export S_LIB_FOLDER=/path/to/code, read, edit and copy ws-session.rc.
